To Test (Fixed):
upgrade all label is scrunched on wind tower on tablet (normal upgrade)?
store easy/med/hard, #paths,enemyorder in settings
road background is white? When road is re-blitted after burn it is overlapping with edges
upgrade buttons not disabling
Wavestreamer doesnt work. old rounds staying in the streamer
test pausing on leave application, interrupt

issues:

                                    Updates

Enemies:
add resistances to enemies. Modifiers = ['speedInc', 'armorInc', 'numInc', 'slowRes', 'burnRes', 'stunRes', 'rewardInc']
-Figure out a way to display the resistance on the enemy. Use same setup for stunnedimage
-display an icon for the resistance in the wavestreamer
-Update the enemy's stats based on the modifier


Tower improvements:
Ice - freeze all enemies around it, not just one. Flash roads to white then fade back to start color.
    Improve roads - better coloring. Remove iceroad if hit by fire.
Air - when shooting activate a light white "cloud" around the tower?
Life - make the shot larger/longer?




Tutorial:
Go over each tower type, attack type. Wind rotates, ice slows, etc.
Placing a tower/dragging to build multiple. $ in the bottom right
Moving a window to the side
Tower group benefits
Road moves when tower in the way
    -path blocking/tower/group removal
    -enemies don't attack your towers
Enemy panel for details on next wave
Health - enemies 1, bosses 5

Out of scope:
leaderboard across players or google play/apple leaderboard and achievement integration
Insane modes  - strings of just air, splinter, strong, or huge crowds. Just one type of tower. Unlimited money/super hard enemies
    earn rewards/achievements that go in game analytics.
lvl 11-16 tower upgrades
Moveable base? Pathfinding changes alongside
Reduce the base size to 2 squsize?
Adjust tower placeholder/dragger by 1 square any direction
Tower Menu redesign? The code is ugly but works
with multiple paths the movelist strategy doesn't work w/ getNextNode and getNEarestRoad functions. A road could not be part of a movelist
Address slowness
Run score past the screen before quitting to main menu. Consider a restart button so you don't have to leave the screen.
Move MainMenu and Game buttons to top bar in info screen (rather than on each screen)
    -Add additional game info to general tab like upgrade all description, only one leader tower
Save and Load games (do this with consideration to also loading different maps)

Statistics screen: add "latest wave" . Total earned and total spent are almost the same thing. time doesn't calculate properly - 12 minute game shows as 3.
    Is score working?
    It's all one game behind?

Path and startpoint flexibility and map designer:
    Start Point changes
        Likely will cause issues with pathfinding
    Base Designer
        Ability to define walls, start, endpoints
            Fixed width/height but can draw shapes on the grid and define walls within
            define the boundary via lines on a grid. outside of the connected lines are walls, inside not.
    Make the map larger - reduce tower size (squsize)fgdfgd

What do we have already?
    pathfinding, though it's dumb (this may be the biggest issue)
        Weighting is a problem within pathfinding, and without weighting the algorithm is crap.
        Can i somehow define a gird and draw lines in it directly from start-endpoints, then assign weights based on distance from those lines?
        sort of a heat map
    Walls can be used as boundaries and as pathfinding representation for obstalces (e.g. can't build a tower over it)
    startpoint, basepoint definitions are easy to modify
    Everything else should work as-is


Build roads as a linked list and push enemies from one to the next.
    dynamically generate animations based on road direction. Go from road 1 to road 4 (change dir) to 6, etc.
        NO MOVE LISTS assigned to enemies. Still need a road list and dirlist to come out of pathfinding.
