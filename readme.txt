Gameplay:

You're under attack! Build towers to keep the enemies from getting to your base. Upgrade your towers to counter the
ever-increasing strength of your enemies.

You can build towers by touching anywhere on the playable area but you cannot fully block the path from reaching the base.
 Click Next Wave to send the enemies at your defenses and collect gold when they are destroyed.
